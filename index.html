                    <p style="text-align: center; text-wrap: balance;">The symptoms you explore here – changes in hand function – are not just data points; they
                        translate into daily challenges. Difficulty with writing can make signing documents or writing
                        notes frustrating. Tremors or rigidity can make buttoning a shirt, using utensils, or holding a
                        cup a slow and arduous process, impacting independence. These seemingly small motor changes can
                        accumulate, affecting one's ability to perform daily activities.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways & Conclusion</h2>
                <h3>Parkinson’s Is Often Invisible—But It’s There</h3>
                <p>
                    We’ve revealed how Parkinson’s can hide behind the familiar faces and voices we know and love – from the 
                    iconic performances of Robin Williams to the athletic prowess of Muhammad Ali. By bringing the disease into 
                    an interactive space through a hoverable hand model and a real-time typing simulation, we reveal how even the 
                    simplest tasks are affected. The core message from Michael J. Fox resonates deeply: 'I have Parkinson’s 
                    Disease. I am not Parkinson’s Disease.' This reminds us that people are more than just their symptoms.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Call to Action: Empathy, Awareness, and Learning More</h3>
                <p>
                    Parkinson’s is more than data points; it’s about human lives, untold stories, and the everyday battles 
                    faced by individuals like those whose experiences we've explored through data. We encourage you to share 
                    what you’ve experienced here, explore the resources on the next page to learn about diagnosis and support,
                     and talk with loved ones or medical professionals if you notice subtle changes in motor control. 
                     By understanding how Parkinson’s shows up in everyday actions like typing, and by reflecting on the 
                     journeys of people like Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali, we can foster greater empathy and drive early 
                     intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>One Thing to Learn:</strong> The most crucial takeaway is that Parkinson's subtly but profoundly impacts everyday actions, and this project demonstrates that by allowing you to directly observe simulated motor symptoms (hand model, pulse viz) and even personally experience a simulated typing difficulty. This firsthand (or close-to-firsthand) encounter makes the 'invisible' challenges of Parkinson's more tangible and fosters genuine empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Our project succeeds because it moves beyond static facts. The 3D hand model allows exploration of affected areas. The 'PULSE' visualization translates abstract data into a perceptible rhythm. Most powerfully, the interactive typing tests—especially the empathy-building second test—allow users to feel a fraction of the challenge, creating a memorable and personal connection to the data and the human experience behind Parkinson's. The personas (MJF, Ali, etc.) help ground these abstract concepts in relatable human stories.

                        <h2>Understanding Parkinson's Disease</h2>
                        <p><strong>Brief medical overview:</strong> Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive
                            neurodegenerative disorder. This means it's a condition where cells in a specific part of the
                            brain gradually break down and are lost. Primarily, Parkinson's affects dopamine-producing
                            neurons (nerve cells) in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a crucial
                            neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in regulating movement, motivation, and mood. As these
                            dopamine-producing cells die off, the brain receives less dopamine, leading to the
                            characteristic symptoms of the disease.</p>
        
                        <p><strong>Who it affects:</strong> Parkinson's Disease can affect anyone, but it is more common in
                            older adults, with the average age of onset being around 60 years old. Men are slightly more
                            likely to develop Parkinson's than women. While it's less common, early-onset Parkinson's can
                            occur before the age of 50. Globally, millions of people live with Parkinson's, and as the
                            population ages, the number of individuals affected is expected to increase. It's estimated that
                            nearly one million people are living with PD in the U.S. alone.</p>
        
                        <p><strong>Why early detection matters:</strong> While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's
                            Disease, early detection and diagnosis are crucial. Initiating treatment and therapeutic
                            interventions (like physical and occupational therapy) sooner can help manage symptoms more
                            effectively, potentially improve quality of life, and slow the progression of some
                            complications. Furthermore, an early diagnosis allows individuals and their families more time
                            to understand the condition, plan for the future, and build a strong support network. Research
                            into new therapies also often benefits from the participation of individuals in the early stages
                            of the disease.</p>
        
                        <h3>Why This Project? The Motivation</h3>
                        <p><strong>Why this visualization approach is better than existing explanations:</strong> Reading
                            about Parkinson's symptoms like bradykinesia (slowness of movement) or tremors can be
                            informative, but often abstract. Static diagrams and text descriptions can only go so far. Our
                            interactive visualizations transform these concepts into dynamic experiences. Instead of just
                            reading about how hand movements are affected, you can <em>see</em> and <em>interact</em> with a
                            model that demonstrates these changes. Instead of just learning that typing patterns can alter,
                            you can <em>feel</em> a simulated rhythm and even test your own.</p>
                        <p><strong>What your interactive experience enables that static resources don't:</strong> Static
                            resources provide information; interactive experiences foster engagement and intuition. With
                            this project, you're not just a passive recipient of facts. You can actively explore how
                            specific hand areas are impacted, compare different medication effects on motor rhythm, and even
                            analyze your own typing data. This direct engagement allows for a more personal and memorable
                            understanding of how Parkinson's manifests.</p>
                        <p><strong>The gap your project fills in Parkinson's education:</strong> While many excellent
                            resources explain the medical aspects of Parkinson's, there's a gap in providing intuitive,
                            experiential learning tools for the general public, patients, and their families. This project
                            aims to bridge that gap by translating complex data and symptoms into accessible visual
                            narratives. It's about making the invisible, or subtly visible, symptoms of Parkinson's more
                            concrete, promoting earlier awareness and deeper empathy.</p>

                        <h2>Dataset: The Tappy Keystroke Dataset</h2>
                        <p>This project utilizes the Tappy Keystroke Dataset, a comprehensive collection of typing behavior data
                            published on PhysioNet in October 2017. The dataset contains keystroke logs from over 200
                            participants, both with and without Parkinson's Disease, collected over periods ranging from weeks
                            to months as they typed naturally on their personal computers.</p>
                        <h3>Data Collection Process</h3>
                        <p>Participants from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia installed a custom
                            keystroke recording application called "Tappy" that captured their typing behavior during everyday
                            computer use—including email, word processing, and web browsing. The software recorded key press and
                            release timestamps with millisecond precision, providing detailed timing information for each
                            keystroke event.</p>
                        <h3>Key Measurements</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hold Time:</strong> Duration between key press and release (in milliseconds)</li>
                            <li><strong>Flight Time:</strong> Time between releasing one key and pressing the next</li>
                            <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Time between pressing consecutive keys</li>
                            <li><strong>Hand Transitions:</strong> Patterns of left-right hand movement during typing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Participant Information</h3>
                        <p>Each participant provided demographic and medical information including age, gender, Parkinson's
                            diagnosis status, symptom severity, medication usage (Levodopa, Dopamine Agonists, MAO-B
                            inhibitors), and self-reported impact on daily activities. This rich metadata enables analysis of
                            how different factors influence typing patterns.</p>
                        <h3>Research Significance</h3>
                        <p>This dataset supports groundbreaking research demonstrating that routine computer interactions can
                            detect early-stage motor changes in Parkinson's Disease. The findings suggest that digital
                            biomarkers derived from everyday typing could potentially serve as accessible screening tools,
                            making this dataset particularly valuable for understanding the subtle ways neurological conditions
                            manifest in daily activities.</p>

                        <h2>The Science Behind the Symptoms</h2>
                        <h3>How Dopamine Loss Affects Movement</h3>
                        <p>Dopamine acts like a messenger in the brain, facilitating smooth, coordinated muscle movement. Think
                            of it as the oil that keeps the gears of your motor system running efficiently. When dopamine levels
                            decrease due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the brain's ability to
                            control movement is impaired. This doesn't mean a person can't move, but movements become less
                            automatic, slower, and more difficult to initiate and control. This disruption leads to the hallmark
                            motor symptoms of Parkinson's like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.</p>
                        <h3>Connection Between Brain Changes and Observable Symptoms</h3>
                        <p>The substantia nigra is part of a larger network in the brain called the basal ganglia, which is
                            critical for motor control, learning, and habit formation. As dopamine-producing cells in the
                            substantia nigra degenerate, this entire network is disrupted.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tremors (shaking):</strong> Often start in a limb, frequently the hand or fingers,
                                especially at rest. This is thought to be due to irregular signaling in the basal ganglia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bradykinesia (slowness of movement):</strong> Makes simple tasks time-consuming and
                                difficult. Everyday actions like walking, dressing, or even speaking can become slow and
                                labored.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rigidity (stiffness):</strong> Can occur in any part of the body, limiting the range of
                                motion and causing pain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Postural instability (impaired balance):</strong> Can lead to problems with balance and
                                coordination, increasing the risk of falls.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These observable symptoms are direct outward manifestations of the underlying dopamine deficiency and
                            its impact on brain circuits.</p>
                        <h3>Why Typing/Motor Tasks Reveal These Changes</h3>
                        <p>Fine motor tasks, such as typing, writing, or buttoning a shirt, require precise coordination and
                            rapid, sequential movements – all heavily reliant on the dopamine-dependent motor pathways.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Typing:</strong> Involves quick, repetitive finger movements, precise timing between
                                keystrokes (flight time), and consistent pressure (hold time). Parkinson's can lead to slower
                                typing speed, increased variability in the time taken to press a key or move between keys, and
                                sometimes a "freezing" or hesitation during typing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Handwriting:</strong> Often becomes smaller (micrographia) and more cramped.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These tasks act as sensitive indicators because they push the motor system to perform at a high level
                            of precision, making even subtle dysfunctions due to dopamine loss more apparent.</p>

                        <h2>Understanding Parkinson's Medications</h2>
                        <p>Parkinson's disease treatment focuses on managing symptoms by addressing the underlying dopamine
                            deficiency in the brain. Different medications work through various mechanisms, each with unique
                            effects on motor control and typing patterns observable in our dataset.</p>
                        <h3>Levodopa (L-DOPA)</h3>
                        <p>Levodopa remains the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease. This medication crosses the
                            blood-brain barrier and converts to dopamine, directly replenishing what the brain can no longer
                            produce adequately. Patients on Levodopa often experience significant improvement in motor symptoms,
                            including more consistent typing rhythms and reduced tremor-related keystroke variability. However,
                            long-term use can lead to "wearing-off" periods and dyskinesias (involuntary movements), which may
                            create distinct patterns in typing data as medication levels fluctuate throughout the day.</p>
                        <h3>Dopamine Agonists (DA)</h3>
                        <p>These medications mimic dopamine's action by directly stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain.
                            Unlike Levodopa, dopamine agonists don't require conversion and provide more steady symptom control.
                            In typing patterns, patients on dopamine agonists may show more consistent hold times and flight
                            times compared to those experiencing Levodopa fluctuations. Common dopamine agonists include
                            pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine patches, each with slightly different timing profiles that
                            can influence daily typing rhythm variations.</p>
                        <h3>MAO-B Inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme that breaks down dopamine, effectively
                            extending the life of available dopamine in the brain. Medications like selegiline and rasagiline
                            are often used in early-stage Parkinson's or as adjuncts to other treatments. Patients on MAO-B
                            inhibitors typically show more subtle improvements in typing consistency, with less dramatic
                            fluctuations in keystroke timing compared to those on Levodopa alone.</p>
                        <h3>Other Medications</h3>
                        <p>This category encompasses various treatments including COMT inhibitors (which extend Levodopa's
                            effectiveness), anticholinergics (which help with tremor), and amantadine (which can reduce
                            dyskinesias). Each medication class contributes differently to motor control, creating unique
                            fingerprints in typing behavior that researchers can identify and analyze.</p>
                        <h3>Medication Timing and Motor Fluctuations</h3>
                        <p>The timing of medication doses significantly impacts motor symptoms and, consequently, typing
                            patterns. Many patients experience "on" periods (when medication is working well) and "off" periods
                            (when symptoms return). These fluctuations are particularly evident in keystroke data, where typing
                            speed, rhythm consistency, and error rates can vary dramatically within the same day. Understanding
                            these patterns helps both patients and physicians optimize medication timing for better quality of
                            life.</p>
                        <h3>Personalized Treatment Approaches</h3>
                        <p>No two patients respond identically to Parkinson's medications. Factors including age at diagnosis,
                            symptom severity, other health conditions, and individual brain chemistry all influence treatment
                            effectiveness. The keystroke data in our dataset reflects this diversity, showing how the same
                            medication can produce different typing pattern improvements across individuals. This
                            personalization aspect makes keystroke analysis particularly valuable for monitoring treatment
                            response and adjusting medication regimens.</p>

                            <li><strong>Early Detection Research:</strong> Researchers are exploring how data from everyday
                                interactions (like typing) could potentially contribute to identifying early warning signs of
                                PD, even before more obvious symptoms appear.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Treatment:</strong> By tracking symptoms and medication responses more
                                closely, doctors may be able to better tailor treatment plans to an individual's specific needs.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong> Technology allows for remote monitoring of patients, which
                                can be especially helpful for those in rural areas or with mobility challenges.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assistive Technologies:</strong> From specialized computer mice to voice-activated
                                software, technology offers tools to help people with PD navigate daily tasks.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <h3>Hope and Treatment Advances</h3>
                        <p>While a cure for Parkinson's remains the ultimate goal, the landscape of treatment and research is
                            continually evolving, offering significant hope.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Symptom Management:</strong> Current medications, like Levodopa, can effectively manage
                                motor symptoms for many years, dramatically improving quality of life. New drug delivery systems
                                and formulations are being developed to provide more consistent symptom control and reduce side
                                effects.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):</strong> For some individuals with advanced PD whose
                                symptoms are not adequately controlled by medication, DBS surgery can be a life-altering option.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Disease-Modifying Therapies:</strong> The most exciting area of research focuses on
                                therapies that could slow, stop, or even reverse the progression of Parkinson's by targeting the
                                underlying disease processes. Clinical trials are underway for various promising approaches,
                                including gene therapies and neuroprotective agents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on Non-Motor Symptoms:</strong> There's increasing recognition and research into
                                managing the often-debilitating non-motor symptoms of PD, such as sleep disorders, depression,
                                and cognitive changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The global research community is actively working on multiple fronts, bringing us closer to new
                            breakthroughs every year.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>Now that we've explored the science and human impact of Parkinson's,
                                let's dive into the interactive visualizations themselves to see these concepts in action.</em>

                        <h2>Understanding the Data: Interpreting Visualizations</h2>
                        <h3>What the Visualizations Show and Why It Matters</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hand Visualization:</strong> This 3D model highlights areas of the hand commonly
                                affected by Parkinson's motor symptoms like tremor and rigidity. Hovering over different parts
                                provides information on how these symptoms manifest. It matters because it makes the abstract
                                concept of "motor impairment" tangible and relatable to everyday hand function.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulse Visualization (Typing Rhythm):</strong> This simulates the rhythm of keystrokes
                                based on 'Hold Time' (how long a key is pressed) and 'Flight Time' (time between releasing one
                                key and pressing the next), using data patterns from the Tappy Keystroke Dataset. It
                                demonstrates how these timings can become more variable or prolonged in individuals with PD,
                                even varying with medication. This matters because it illustrates a subtle, quantifiable way
                                motor control can be affected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Typing Test & Analysis:</strong> This section allows you to see a visual representation
                                (line chart) of your own keystroke latencies compared to a representative Parkinson's patient's
                                pattern from the Tappy dataset. It matters because it provides a direct comparison, showing how
                                technology can potentially identify these subtle motor biomarkers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>How to Interpret the Patterns Users See</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hand Model:</strong> Areas that light up represent common sites of PD symptoms. The
                                descriptions aim to connect these to functional difficulties.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulse Visualization:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Longer/Shorter Pulses (Hold Time):</strong> The "PULSE" button's illumination
                                        duration represents hold time. Notice if it's consistently long, short, or varies
                                        greatly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Longer/Shorter Gaps (Flight Time):</strong> The time between pulses represents
                                        flight time. Observe the rhythm – is it steady, or are there irregular pauses?</li>
                                    <li><strong>Variability:</strong> Increased inconsistency in either hold or flight times can
                                        be a key indicator.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Typing Test Line Chart:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Your Line (e.g., Blue):</strong> Shows your latency (time between successive
                                        keystrokes) for each character you type.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Comparison Line (e.g., Red/Dashed):</strong> Shows a representative pattern from
                                        a dataset of an individual with Parkinson's.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Look for:</strong> Differences in average latency (is one line generally
                                        higher?), variability (is one line much 'spikier' or more erratic than the other?), and
                                        overall trends.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Limitations and Considerations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> The "Parkinson's patterns" shown are representative examples
                                from datasets and do not reflect every individual's experience with PD. Parkinson's symptoms
                                vary greatly from person to person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Not a Diagnostic Tool:</strong> These visualizations are for educational and awareness
                                purposes only. They are <strong>not</strong> diagnostic tools. Any concerns about motor symptoms
                                or potential Parkinson's should be discussed with a qualified healthcare professional.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Simplification:</strong> For clarity, some complexities of the data (like specific
                                key transitions or exact pressure) are simplified in these visualizations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Typing Style:</strong> Individual typing habits, fatigue, and even keyboard type can
                                influence typing patterns, independent of any medical condition.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Interpretation Guide: A Deeper Dive into Typing Data</h2>
                        <h3>What "Normal" vs. "Atypical" Patterns Look Like (in Typing Data)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>"Normal" or Control Patterns:</strong> Typically, individuals without motor impairments
                                exhibit relatively consistent and faster keystroke latencies and hold times. On a line chart,
                                this might look like a line that is generally lower (faster) and less "spiky" (more consistent).
                                The rhythm in the pulse visualization would appear more regular.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Atypical" Patterns (suggestive of PD-related changes, for educational
                                    illustration):</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Increased Latency/Flight Time:</strong> The time taken to move between keys may
                                        be longer on average. The line chart for latency might be generally higher. The "pulse"
                                        may have longer gaps.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Increased Hold Time:</strong> Keys might be held down for longer durations. The
                                        "pulse" might stay lit longer.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Increased Variability:</strong> This is a key characteristic. Both latency and
                                        hold times might fluctuate more significantly from one keystroke to the next. The line
                                        chart would appear more "spiky" or erratic. The "pulse" rhythm would be less steady.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Bradykinesia Effect:</strong> Overall slowness can manifest as generally higher
                                        values for both hold and flight times.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Freezing/Hesitation:</strong> May appear as unusually long latencies or flight
                                        times at certain points.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Why Variations Occur</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Individual Differences:</strong> Everyone has a unique typing style, speed, and rhythm,
                                even without any medical condition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parkinson's Heterogeneity:</strong> PD affects individuals differently. The type,
                                severity, and combination of motor symptoms vary widely.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medication Effects:</strong> As seen in the "Pulse Visualization," medications can alter
                                motor performance, sometimes improving consistency and speed, but effects can fluctuate
                                ("on-off" periods).</li>
                            <li><strong>Task Complexity:</strong> The specific keys being pressed (e.g., common vs. rare
                                transitions, same hand vs. alternating hands) can influence timing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fatigue/Attention:</strong> Like anyone, individuals with PD may experience changes in
                                performance due to fatigue or lapses in attention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disease Progression:</strong> Symptoms typically change over time as the disease
                                progresses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Clinical Significance of the Measurements (Hold Time, Latency/Flight Time)</h3>
                        <p>While this project is not for diagnosis, these metrics are of interest in clinical research for
                            several reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Objective Biomarkers:</strong> Keystroke dynamics offer a way to collect objective,
                                quantifiable data about motor function, which can be more reliable than subjective assessments
                                alone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sensitivity to Subtle Changes:</strong> Typing can reveal subtle motor impairments that
                                might not be obvious in gross motor tasks, potentially aiding in earlier detection research.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring Disease Progression:</strong> Changes in these metrics over time could
                                potentially help track how Parkinson's is progressing in an individual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assessing Treatment Efficacy:</strong> Researchers can use these measures to evaluate
                                how well different treatments or interventions are working to improve motor control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-Invasive and Accessible:</strong> Typing data can be collected easily and
                                non-invasively using standard keyboards, making it a practical tool for research and potentially
                                for remote patient monitoring in the future.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The interpretation of these metrics in a clinical setting is complex
                            and requires sophisticated analysis by trained professionals, considering a wide range of factors.

                        <h2>Methodology Notes</h2>
                        <h3>Data Collection (Underlying PD Patterns)</h3>
                        <p>The representative Parkinson's patterns and data shown in these visualizations are based on
                            anonymized datasets, primarily the Tappy Keystroke Dataset, from research studies involving
                            individuals with Parkinson's Disease and control participants. In these studies, participants
                            typically perform standardized typing tasks or have their natural typing recorded on computer
                            keyboards. Specialized software records the precise timing of each keystroke, including when a key
                            is pressed down and when it's released. Demographic and clinical information (like medication status
                            and symptom severity, where ethically permissible and consented) is also often collected.</p>
                        <h3>Why These Specific Metrics Were Chosen (Hold Time, Latency/Flight Time)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hold Time (Duration of Key Press):</strong> This metric can reflect aspects of motor
                                control such as bradykinesia (slowness in completing a movement) or rigidity (stiffness
                                affecting the ability to release a key quickly).</li>
                            <li><strong>Latency/Flight Time (Time Between Key Presses):</strong> This measures the speed and
                                coordination of initiating the next movement. It can be affected by bradykinesia, tremor
                                (interfering with smooth transitions), and difficulties with sequencing movements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These metrics are relatively straightforward to measure, have been shown in research to differ
                            between individuals with PD and controls, and can be intuitively understood in the context of typing
                            rhythm.</p>
                        <h3>Reliability and Validity Considerations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Keystroke dynamics have shown good test-retest reliability in
                                research settings, meaning individuals tend to produce similar patterns when tested multiple
                                times under similar conditions (though natural variation always exists).</li>
                            <li><strong>Validity:</strong> Studies have demonstrated that these metrics can validly
                                differentiate between groups (e.g., PD vs. controls) and can correlate with clinical measures of
                                motor impairment. However, their predictive validity for individual diagnosis or fine-grained
                                tracking is still an active area of research.</li>
                            <li><strong>Confounding Factors:</strong> It's important to acknowledge that factors like age,
                                typing skill, fatigue, keyboard type, and even mood can influence these metrics. Research
                                methodologies aim to control for or account for these variables. The data presented here is
                                simplified for educational purposes.</li>
